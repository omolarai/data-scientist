People are always looking out for the best possible deals with regards to their living arrangements. So, in this project I will seek to assist people who are looking to rent an apartment in Vienna. This project will be structured using the following outline:\n#### If they are looking to move to Vienna they can see:\n* which district has cheaper rent. And/or,\n* they can choose to live in residential or commercial areas and can see for example which residential district is best\n\n#### Also, if they already live in one of the 23 districts in Vienna they will be able to see:\n* If they are paying more than the average price for their apartment. And/or,\n* If there are similar districts to theirs with lower rents"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\n* The data on apartments (size, number of rooms, address, and price) is collected by scraping a local website with apartment listings (willhaben.at)\n* Using geopy, I find the coordinates for each district, and then\n* using Foursquare I collect the closest venues (supermarket, restaurant, park, etc.\n* After the data collection I can run k-means clustering to cluster the districts into residential and commercial areas, and then\n* visualize all the data on a single choropleth map."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": ""}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
